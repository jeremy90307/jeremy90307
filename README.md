## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Tasi Zhong Han. I enjoy learning and taking
on challenges. I excelled at building relationships and
expanding my connections during my undergraduate
years. I am now a second-year master's student,
committed to self-improvement. I have a passion for
embedded systems and spend my free time learning
more about them.
